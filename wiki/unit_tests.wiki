=Unit Test=

sfntly C++ port uses Google testing framework for unit testing.

All test cases are under src/test.

To run the unit test, you need to compile sfntly first, then copy Tuffy.ttf from data/ext to the folder that unit_test(.exe) is located.  Run the unit_test.

If you are only interested in one test case, for example, you are working on name table and only wants name editing test, you can use the gtest_filter flag in command line.

{{{
unit_test --gtest_filter=NameEditing.*
}}}

For more info regarding running a subset of gtest, please see [http://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/V1_6_AdvancedGuide GTest Advanced Guide].

It's strongly suggested to run unit_tests with valgrind.  The following example shows a typical test command

{{{
valgrind --leak-check=full -v ./unit_test --gtest_filter=*.*-FontData.*
}}}

FontData.* tests are the longest and you may want to bypass them during development.  They shall be run in bots, however.
